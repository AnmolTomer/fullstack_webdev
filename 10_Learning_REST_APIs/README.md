# 10. Learning REST APIs

## Intro

- Everyday we interact with apps and websites for various purposes, be it streaming new marvel TV show, searching for travel deals, scrolling through social media, one thing that's common among all these is that they are pulling in information from the internet through REST APIs. So what is a REST API? That's what we will see.

- When you open a social media app, say on desktop, there is a header with some navigation options and a stream which updates continuously as we scroll down. The website itself is just a framework of templates for application. It provides us physical headers, the sidebars, the main content area, and skeleton for posts to be displayed.

- When we visit the website, this entire framework is downloaded and runs in browser. It sends automated requests to representational state transferfer application programming interface or REST API for that service. REST API sends the data in JSON format and framework pulls the bits and pieces out and places it in the templates available to show the data that's already present in browser.

- When we reach at the end of the list, another REST request is sent, received and parsed. Using your smartphone ? No worries, the same REST request is sent, received and parsed in an application as well.

- In a nutshell, REST APIs allow us to fully separate the presentation of the content from the content itself. It allows us to build lightning fast applications, that consume data rather than the entire pages, which leads to faster solutions and more scalable ones, and are ready for whatever changes we might incorporate in future. Knowing how REST APIs work and how to leverage their power, is the key to building powerful websites and web applications.
