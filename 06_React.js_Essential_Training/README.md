- React can help you build projects of all kinds and one of the most sought after front end library.

- This course goes over React's core concepts, we will go over concepts like testing, data fetching and routing.

- React.js is JS at its core, so a little bit of js would be really helpful before getting started. We will use ES6 syntax throughout. We will also install some of the packages using npm. That's all you need to know to get started with learning React.

# 1. What is React?

## 01_01 What is React?

- React is a JS library, that we can use to create user interfaces. It was created at facebook and opensourced in March 2013. Since then react has expanded beyond the web with React Native, a tool that allows you to create native mobile applications using React. One of the best resources that you can use to learn React is official documentation of react available at [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

- React is an increasingly popular library with 10k+ stars on GitHub and we have already gone over tech giants that use React.

- React has component architecture that makes it faster and easier to build amazing products for web and native platforms.

## 01_02 Setting up Chrome Tools for React

- We install react developer tools, chrome extension from chrome web store. You can open developer tools by using `Ctrl+Shift+J`. When you are on a website which uses react, the developer tools extension lights up to either blue or red, depending on the development or production build of react that's running on that website.

- As our apps become more robust, the components tab under developer tools will be really helpful to understand the structure of the project and to debug issues.

- React Developer Tools are also available for Firefox. Present in addons.mozilla.org.
