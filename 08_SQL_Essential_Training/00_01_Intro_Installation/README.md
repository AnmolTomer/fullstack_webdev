# 0. Introduction

## 0.1 Understanding SQL & Course Overview

- Goal is to understand and use SQL effectively in any DB environment. We will start with basics, how databases are organized, how relational databases work. We will see how to use `SELECT` statement and how to create, update and delete data from tables.

- We will see how to effectively format our code and how the basic structure of SQL works. We will go over creating and deleting tables, data types, aggregate queries, joins, transactions, sub selects, views and other features of SQL.

- Finally we will go over creation of a CRUD application. Understanding SQL will help you understand and work with relational database applications.

- Course allows you to use standard SQL in your applications. Since, most modern database systems were developed before SQL was standardized, each system tends to use variations of the language. Some of these variations deviate from the standard. This course uses SQLite for all the code and demonstrations.

- SQLite is likely different from your database system, and that's expected, as every DB has their own variations of SQL. SQLite follows the standard more closely than most other database systems. SQLite comes pre-installed on most platforms, including most web servers, mobile devices, and even desktop OS environments. Entire DB is stored in a single cross-platform file.

- Other database systems will be different. Most DBMS predate the standard by many years, they may need to support a lot of non standard legacy code. Syntax used by your system may vary from the standard and some standard features may be missing, and other non standard features may be common practice. This course is focused on providing a solid foundation in standard SQL.
