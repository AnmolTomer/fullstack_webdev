# CSS Essential Training

## 0. Introduction

CSS is a fundamental part of web design, because it controls how your web pages look. Without it, websites would only be able to display text on white backgrounds. We use CSS to take our plain HTML websites to next level in terms of aesthetics and user experience.

In this course we cover all the foundations of CSS, we will cover how CSS is structured to frequently used CSS styles and the various ways CSS let's you layout a page.

You needn't know a lot, basic understanding of HTML, comfortable using a text editor is all that's needed.

All the exercises of this course can be found on CSS Essential Training Collection page. [ðŸ”— Here](https://codepen.io/collection/DQgmdM/?grid_type=list)

## 1. Introduction

- **HTML and CSS**

HTML defines the structure of content on webpage, and adds semantic meaning to the content. CSS controls the appearence of the HTML elements and separates the presentation from the content.

- **Browser Developer Tools**

Every browser these days includes browser developer tools that you can access by pressing `F12`, `Right Click > Inspect` etc. and this can be used to inspect HTML, CSS and JS on any webpage.

- **Referencing CSS**

Different ways in which we can add CSS to our webpage are: `External`, `Inline` and `Internal`.

1. **External**: This method refers to using a separate CSS file and must be saved with CSS file extension. We can load external CSS file into the HTML with a `link` tag or `@import` method. `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">` Link method is added to head with attributes rel and href. The attribute `type="text/css"` was required for older HTML versions, but is no longer required in HTML5.

Using an external stylesheet is recommended as it separates the CSS from the HTML making it easier to manage. An external stylesheet can be reused throughout a project by linking the same CSS file to any HTML file as required, and any changes made to this CSS file would reflect on all the HTMl pages consistently.

You can use more than one CSS file, but having too many CSS files defeats the purpose of having separate stylesheets if you are maintaining a bunch of different files. However for larger projects, having one giant CSS file can also become unruly, so sometimes breaking the CSS files into smaller files can make it easier to manage and do changes.

Another external method is that we just add `@import` rule, which imports one or more stylesheets into HTML files or into another CSS file. This method can be used to import all the smaller CSS files into a single CSS file which is then loaded into the HTML document.

```css
/* styles.css  */
@import url("/styles/layout.css") @import url("/styles/typography.css") /*  */
  @import url("/styles/buttons.css");
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<head>
  <style>
    @import url("css/styles.css");
  </style>
</head>
```

This method isn't used these days as `@import` doesn't allow for parallel downloads and meaning the page must download an entire stylesheet before it loads rest of the page. More on this, from a blog by Steve Souders from 2009 that's still relevant. [Here](https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/09/dont-use-import/)

Import method however is used with CSS preprocessors such as SASS and or LESS or when CSS files are compiled into one file.

`link` method is used and recommended if you are directly working with CSS on your project.

`Inline Method:` uses a style attribute which is added to the opening HTML tag, and we add CSS rules as value which applies style directly to the HTML element. The inline method should be used only when necessary as it is hard to manage and you have to edit it individually. Multiple styles must be added to the same style attribute and more you add, the harder it is to read. Also, CSS added by any other method is overwritten if you have inline CSS defined for an element, creating more potential for conflict with other CSS style rules.

`Internal Method:` This is the third option, and in this method in the head of the html page, we create `style` element and we enter CSS rules for each element just as we would've for external CSS file. This method if more flexible than inline method because instead of adding styles to each individual element, CSS selectors are used to apply a style to all the matched elements. More about selectors later on. While internal CSS works better than inline CSS, it is still inefficient, as you cannot import it, and CSS rules need to be copied to each HTML page manually, something you needn't do in external CSS as importing does the job. Internal method is best for short blocks of CSS that are page specific.
