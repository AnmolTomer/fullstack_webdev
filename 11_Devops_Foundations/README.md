# 11. DevOps Foundations

# 00. Introduction

- We will be learning fundamentals of DevOps. DevOps can help you whether you are a developer or a system administrator or something in between. Just the fact that the word DevOps gets reduced to technology is a manifestation of how badly we need a cultural shift, said by Patrick Debois. We will go over culture issues, infrastructure automation, continuous delivery and reliability engineering.

- We will learn about concepts along with common tools and practices used in their implementation. We will also go over emerging technologies, things like moving from cloud to containers to serverless architectures, as well as the conjunction of DevOps and Info Sec, `DevSecOps`.
